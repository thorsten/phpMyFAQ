# phpMyFAQ Manual

phpMyFAQ is a comprehensive, multilingual FAQ system that is entirely database-driven.
It is compatible with a variety of databases for data storage and requires PHP 8.3+ for data access.
The system features a multi-language Content Management System equipped with a WYSIWYG editor and an Image Manager.
It also provides real-time search capabilities with Elasticsearch or OpenSearch.

phpMyFAQ supports flexible multi-user functionality,
offering user and group-based permissions on categories and records.
It includes a wiki-like revision feature, a news system, and configurable user-tracking.
With support for over 40 languages, it also boasts enhanced automatic content negotiation and HTML5- / CSS3-based
responsive templates.
These Twig-based templates allow for the inclusion of your own text and HTML snippets.

Additional features include PDF support, a backup system, a dynamic sitemap, related FAQs, tagging, a plugin system, 
and built-in spam protection systems.
It also supports OpenLDAP, Microsoft Active Directory, Microsoft Entra ID, and a MCP Server for AI agents.
The system is easy to install, thanks to its user-friendly installation script.

phpMyFAQ is versatile
and can be run on almost any web hosting provider or deployed in the cloud using a Docker container.
