# phpMyFAQ Manual

phpMyFAQ is a comprehensive, multilingual FAQ system that is entirely database-driven.
It is compatible with a variety of databases for data storage and requires PHP 8.4+ for data access.
The system features a multi-language Content Management System equipped with a WYSIWYG editor and an Image Manager.
It also provides real-time search capabilities with Elasticsearch or OpenSearch.

phpMyFAQ supports flexible multi-user functionality, offering user and group-based permissions on categories and FAQs.
It includes a wiki-like revision feature, a news system, and configurable user-tracking.
Administrators can monitor user activities through detailed log files.
Additionally, phpMyFAQ supports adding its own custom pages to the FAQ system.
With support for over 40 languages, it also boasts enhanced automatic content negotiation and HTML5- / CSS3-based
responsive templates.
These Twig-based templates allow for the inclusion of your own text and HTML snippets. There's also a built-in plugin
system for further customization.

Additional features include PDF support, a backup system, a dynamic sitemap, related FAQs, tagging, a plugin system,
and built-in spam protection systems.
phpMyFAQ also supports two-factor authentication (2FA) for enhanced security.
An AI-assisted translation feature helps translate content into multiple languages using Google Cloud Translation, DeepL,
Azure Translator, Amazon Translate, or LibreTranslate.
A REST API is available for integration with other systems.
It also supports OpenLDAP, Microsoft Active Directory, Microsoft Entra ID, and an MCP Server for AI agents.
The system is easy to install, thanks to its user-friendly installation script.
