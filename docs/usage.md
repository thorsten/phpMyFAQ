# 4. Use phpMyFAQ

The public phpMyFAQ frontend has a simple, HTML5/CCS3 based default layout based on
[Bootstrap v5.3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/). The header has the main links for the all categories, propose new
FAQs, add questions, open questions, and a login. On the left side you only see the main categories. You can also change
the current language at the bottom of the FAQ, use the global search in the center of the FAQ or use the login box in
the upper right if you have a valid user account. On the right side you see a list of the most popular FAQ records, the
latest records, and the sticky FAQ records. On the pages with the FAQ records you'll see the other records of the
current category and the tag cloud if you're using tagging.
