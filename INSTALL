phpMyFAQ Installation

Open your browser and type in the following URL:

http://www.example.com/path/to/your/faq/install/setup.php

Substitute www.yourdomain.com with your actual domain name. When the
site is loaded enter the address of your database server
(e.g. db.provider.com), your database username and password as well as the
database name. The datebase must be availible before running the
installation script. You can leave the prefix-field empty. If you are
planning on using multiple FAQs in one database you will have to use a
tableprefix, though (i.e. sport for a sports-FAQ, weather for a
weather-FAQ, etc.). Please note that only letters and an underline:
"_" can be used as the prefix. When using multiple FAQs you need to
install them independently into different directories (e.g. faq1/,
faq2/, faq3/ etc.). In addition you can enter your language, default
here is English. Furthermore you should register your name, your email
address and - very importantly - your password. You must enter the
password twice and it have to be at least six places long. Then click
the button "install" to initialize the tables in your database.

For more information please read the documentation (documentation.en.html)
carefully.
