        comprehensible, even for newcomers.

    <p><strong><a name="2"></a>2.Installation</strong></p>
    <p><strong><a name="2a"></a>2.a. Requirements for phpMyFAQ</strong></p>
    <p>phpMyFAQ addresses a database system via PHP. In order to install it you
    will need a web server that meets the following requirements:</p>
    <ul type="square">
        <li><strong><a href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a></strong>
        <ul type="circle">
            <li>from version 5.3.2 (recommended: latest PHP 5.x)</li>
            <li>register_globals = off (recommended)</li>
            <li>safe_mode = off (recommended)</li>
            <li>memory_limit = 64M</li>
            <li>GD support</li>
            <li>XMLWriter support</li>
            <li>JSON support</li>
            <li>Filter support</li>
            <li>SPL support</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>
            <strong>Web server</strong> (
            <a href="http://httpd.apache.org">Apache</a> 2.x or
            <a href="http://www.nginx.net/">nginx</a> 0.7+ or
            <a href="http://www.lighttpd.net">lighttpd</a> 1.0+ or
            <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">IIS</a> 7.0+)
        </li>
        <li><strong>Database server</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://www.mysql.com">MySQL</a> 5.x with the MySQL extension (recommended: 5.5.x)</li>
                <li><a href="http://www.mysql.com">MySQL</a> 5.x with the MySQLi extension (recommended: 5.5.x)</li>
                <li><a href="http://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a> 8.x (recommended: latest 8.x)</li>
                <li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql/">Microsoft SQL Server</a> 2000, 2005, 2008</li>
                <li><a href="http://www.sqlite.org">SQLite</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://montyprogram.com/mariadb/">MariaDB</a> 5.x (experimental)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>correctly set: access permissions, owner, group</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can only run phpMyFAQ successfully, when the PHP directive safe_mode is
    set to off, further constraints affect the directives open_basedir and disable_functions,
    which can be set in the central php.ini or the httpd.conf respectively.</p>
    <p>In case PHP runs as module of the Apache, you will have to be able to do a
    chown on the files before installation. The files and directories must be owned
    by the Apache user.</p>
    <p>You can determine which versions your web server is running by creating a
    file called <strong>info.php</strong> with the following content:</p>
    <code>&lt;?php phpinfo(); ?&gt;</code>
    <p>Upload this file to your webspace and open it using your browser. The
    installation-script checks which version of PHP is installed on your server.
    Should you not meet the requirements, you cannot start the installation
    process.</p>
    <p>In case you have PHP below 5.3.2 installed you cannot use phpMyFAQ.</p>
    <p>phpMyFAQ uses a modern HTML5/CSS3 powered markup. The supported browsers
    are Mozilla Firefox 3.6 and later (Windows/MacOS X/Linux), Safari 5.x or later
    (MacOS X/Windows/iOS), Chrome 5 or later (Windows/MacOS X/Linux), Opera 11.0
    or later (Windows/MacOS X/Linux) and Internet Explorer 8 or later for Windows.
    You have to enable JavaScript for the Ajax based functions as well.</p>
    <p>If you're using <em>lighttpd</em> you have to set the following configuration:</p>
    <code>cgi.fix_pathinfo 1</code>
    <p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>


    <hr style="width: 90%; height: 1px;"  />
    <p>
        <strong><a name="2b"></a>2.b. Preparations</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Please unzip the downloaded archive on your hard disk.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can modify the layout of phpMyFAQ using templates. A description of how this is done can be found
        <a href="#6">below</a>. Copy all unzipped files to your web server in a directory using FTP. A good choice
        would be the directory <strong>faq/</strong>.<br />
        <strong>Important:</strong><br />
        Writing permission for your script is needed in this directory to be able to write the file
        <strong>config/database.php</strong> during installation. This is the case if you're running PHP as CGI or as
        mod_php with disabled safe-mode. The installation script will stop when your web server isn't configured as
        needed.
    </p>
    <p>
        It might help to set chmod 777 to the whole phpMyFAQ directory to avoid problems during the installation. If
        you're running a very restrictive mod_php installation you should keep the chmod 777 for the following files
        and directories even after the successful installation:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>the directory <strong>config/</strong></li>
      <li>the directory <strong>attachments/</strong></li>
      <li>the directory <strong>images/</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        All other directories shouldn't be world-writable for your own security.
    </p>
    <p>
        The database user needs the permissions for CREATE, DROP, ALTER, INDEX, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE and SELECT on all
        tables in the database.
    </p>
    <p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>


    <hr style="width: 90%; height: 1px;"  />
    <p><strong><a name="2c"></a>2.c. Install-Script</strong></p>
    <p>Open your browser and type in the following URL:</p>
    <code>http://www.example.com/faq/install/setup.php</code>
    <p>Substitute <strong>www.example.com</strong> with your actual domain name.
    When the site is loaded enter the address of your database server (e.g.
    db.provider.com), your database username and password as well as the database
    name. The database have to be created with UTF-8 chraracter set before
    running the installation script. You can leave the prefix-field empty. If
    you are planning on using multiple FAQs in one database you will have to
    use a table prefix, though (i.e. <em>sport</em> for a sports-FAQ,
    <em>weather</em> for a weather-FAQ, etc.). Please note that only letters
    and an underline: "_" can be used as the prefix.</p>
    <p>If your PHP was compiled with the LDAP extension you can add your LDAP
    information, too. You have to insert your LDAP information, too.</p>
    <p>When using multiple FAQs you need to install them independently into
    different directories (e.g. faq1/, faq2/. faq3/ etc.). In addition you can
    enter your language, default here is English. Furthermore you should register
    your name, your email address and - very importantly - your password. You
    must enter the password twice and it have to be at least six places long.
    Then click the button <strong>"install"</strong> to initialize the tables in
    your database.</p>
    <p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>


    <hr style="width: 90%; height: 1px;"  />
    <p><strong><a name="2d"></a>2.d. First Steps</strong></p>
    <p>You can enter the public area of your FAQ by entering</p>
    <code>http://www.example.com/faq/index.php</code>
    <p>into your browser's address field. Your FAQ will be empty and presented
    in the the standard layout.</p>
    <p>To configure phpMyFAQ point your browser to</p>
    <code>http://www.example.com/faq/admin/index.php</code>
    <p>Use the username <strong>admin</strong> and your selected password for your
    first login into the admin section.</p>
    <p>Some variables that doesn't change regularly, they can be edited in the file
    <em>config/constants.php</em>. You can change the</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the time zone of your server (default: "Europe/Berlin")</li>
        <li>the timeout in the admin section (default: 30 minutes)</li>
        <li>the timeout warning pop-up in the admin section (default: 5 minutes)</li>
        <li>the solution id start value (default: 1000)</li>
        <li>the incremental value of the solution id (default: 1)</li>
        <li>the number of records in the Top10 (default: 10)</li>
        <li>the number of latest records (default: 5)</li>
        <li>the number of open questions in the RSS feed (default: 50)</li>
        <li>flag with which Latest and Top Ten RSS feeds will be forced to use the
        current PMF SEO URL schema (default: true)</li>
        <li>flag with which Google site map will be forced to use the current PMF
        SEO URL schema (default: true)</li>
        <li>flag with which Yahoo site map will be forced to use the current PMF
        SEO URL schema (default: true)</li>
        <li>the number with which the Tags Cloud list is limited to (default: 50)</li>
        <li>the number with which the Auto-complete list is limited to (default: 20)</li>
    </ul>

    <hr style="width: 90%; height: 1px;" />
    <p><strong><a name="2e"></a>2.e. Notes regarding the search-function</strong></p>
    <p>The boolean full-text search will only work with MySQL and if there are some
    entries in the database (5 or more). The term you are looking for should also
    not be in more than 50% of all your entries, or it will automatically be
    excluded from search. This is not a bug, but rather a feature of MySQL.</p>
    <p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>


    <hr style="width: 90%; height: 1px;" />
    <p><strong><a name="2f"></a>2.f. Automatic content negotiation</strong></p>
    <p>To set the default language in your browser you have to set a variable
    that gets passed to the web server. How this is done depends on the browser
    you are using.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mozilla Firefox<br />Tools -> Options -> Content -> Languages</li>
        <li>Mozilla Seamonkey and later versions<code>Edit -> Preferences ->
        Navigator -> Languages</code></li>
        <li>Safari<br />Safari uses the MacOS X system preferences to determine
        your preferred language:<code>System preferences -> International -> Language</code></li>
        <li>Opera<br />Most versions:<code>File -> Preferences -> Languages</code>
        Linux/*BSD versions 5.x and 6.x:<code>File -> Preferences -> Document -> Languages</code></li>
        <li>Internet Explorer<br />Windows:<code>Tools or View or Extras -> Internet Options -> (General) Languages</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>


    <hr style="width: 90%; height: 1px;" />
    <p><strong><a name="2g"></a>2.g. PHP settings</strong></p>
    <p>If you're able to edit the php.ini file, please check that the variable
    <em>file_upload = On</em> is set; otherwise the file upload will not work
    for the attachments. You should disable the <em>safe_mode</em> because it
    will cause trouble when you're trying to upload files or if you want to use
    the user tracking.</p>
    <p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>


    <hr style="width: 90%; height: 1px;" />
    <p><strong><a name="2h"></a>2.h. Enabling mod_rewrite support</strong></p>
    <p><em>Apache Web server</em></p>
    <p>If you want to enable the search engine optimization you have to rename
    the file _.htaccess to .htaccess in the root directory where your FAQ is located.
    Then you have to activate the mod_rewrite support in the admin back-end in the
    configuration page. You also have to edit the path information for the
    "RewriteBase". If you installed phpMyFAQ on root directory "/" you should set in
    </p>
    <code>
    RewriteBase /
    </code>

        <strong><a name="2i"></a>2.i. Enabling LDAP support</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        If you're entered the correct LDAP information during the installation you have to enable the LDAP support
        in the configuration in the admin backend. Now your user can authenticate themselves in phpMyFAQ against
        your LDAP server or even an Microsoft Active Directory.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you need special options for your LDAP or ADS configuration you have to edit the LDAP constants in the
        file <strong>config/constants_ldap.php</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you want to add LDAP support later, you can use the file <strong>config/ldap.php.original</strong> as
        template and if you rename it to <strong>config/ldap.php</strong> you can use the LDAP features as well after
        you enabled it in the administration backend.

        phpMyFAQ implements a static solution ID which never changes. This ID is displayed next to the question on a

        possible to enter only the ID <em>1024</em> in the input field of the full-text search box and you'll be
        automatically redirected to the FAQ record with the ID <em>1024</em>. By default the numbers start at ID
        <em>1000</em> but you can change this value in the file <em>inc/constants.php</em>. You can also change the
        value of the incrementation of the static IDs.

    <p><strong><a name="2n"></a>2.n. Attachments</strong></p>
    <p>
        phpMyFAQ supports encrypted attachments. The  encryption is done using the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a> algorithm implemented in mcrypt
        extension (if avaliable) or with native PHP Rijndael implementation. The key size vary depending on
        implementation used and can be max 256 bits long. Use of mcrypt extension is strongly recommended because of
        performance reasons, its avaliability is checked automatically at the run time.
    </p>
    <p>
        See the migration section if you're migrating from earlier versions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please be aware:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Disabling encryption will cause all files be saved unencrypted. In this case you'll benefit sparing disk
            space, because identical files will be saved only once.
        </li>
        <li>
            Do not change the default attachment encryption key once files was uploaded. Doing so will cause all the
            previously uploaded files to be wrong decrypted. If you need to change the default key, you will have to
            re-upload all files.
        </li>
        <li>
            Always memorize your encryption keys. There is no way to decrypt files without a correct key.
        </li>
        <li>
            Files are always saved with names based on a virtual hash generated from several tokens (just like key
            and issue id etc), so there is no way to asses a file directly using the name it was uploaded under.
        </li>
        <li>
            Download continuation isn't (yet?) supported.

        <strong><a name="2p"></a>2.p. Caching</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        phpMyFAQ supports server-side caching. Supported cache services are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Varnish</strong>
            <p>Required are Varnish Cache accelerator &gt;=3.0 and Varnish PECL extension &gt;= 0.9.1</p>
            <p>VCL sample, merge it with yours:</p>
            <pre>
backend default {
        .host = "127.0.0.1";
        .port = "8070";
}

sub vcl_recv {
        if (!(req.url ~ "^/admin.*")) {
                unset req.http.cookie;
        }
}

sub vcl_fetch {
        if (!(req.url ~ "^/admin.*")) {
                unset beresp.http.set-cookie;
                unset beresp.http.expires;
                unset beresp.http.cache-control;
                unset beresp.http.pragma;
                unset beresp.http.last-modified;

                set beresp.ttl = 86000s;
        }

        if (req.url ~ "/.*(action=add|action=contact|action=ask).*") {
                set beresp.ttl = 0s;
        }
}
            </pre>
            <p>
                As you can see, all cookie are deleted except the admin area, which allows the cache to perform on the
                frontend, but work as admin in the backend. Also for the non admin area all the cache related backend
                headers get deleted, and ttl is set to one day. There is almost much room for improvement. Please notify
                us, if you have discovered some essential VCL improvements to this sample, so we can improve this
                documentation.
            </p>
            <p>Once an article is saved, its cache and all related items cache is cleared.</p>

        Your current 2.5.x, 2.6.x and 2.7.x templates are <strong>barely</strong> compatible with phpMyFAQ 2.8 because
        we changed the complete CSS framework to Twitter Bootstrap. We also using now a lot of Ajax in the frontend.

        The public phpMyFAQ frontend has a simple, HTML5 based default layout based on

        all categories, instant response, add FAQs, add questions, open questions, sitemap and contact. On the left side
        you only see the main categories. You can also change the current language at the bottom of the FAQ, use the
        global search in the center of the FAQ or use the login box in the upper right if you have a valid user account.
        On the right side you see a list of the most popular FAQ records, the latest records, and the sticky FAQ
        records. On the pages with the FAQ records you'll see the other records of the current category and the tag

    <p>
        As written above there's a select box for changing the current language. If you're visiting a phpMyFAQ powered
        FAQ, the current language will be the one you're browser is using or the language which was selected by the
        administrator of the FAQ. If you change the language you'll see the categories and records of your chosen
        language. If there are no entries in this language you'll see no entries. If you're switching to languages with
        right to left text direction (for example Arabic, Hebrew or Farsi) the whole default layout will be switching
        according to the text direction.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> phpMyFAQ uses a WYSIWYG online editor that has support for multiple languages. However,
        phpMyFAQ comes only with English language pack installed so changing the current language will not change the
        language of WYSIWYG editor. If you would like to have WYSIWYG editor in another language, just download the
        latest <a href="http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/download_i18n.php">language pack</a>, extract it and upload the
        extracted files to admin/editor directory under your phpMyFAQ's installation directory on your web server.

        The users have to add a question, select a category, and they have to insert their name and e-mail address. If
        the spam protection is enabled they have to enter the correct captcha code, too. By default new questions won't
        be displayed and have to be activated by an administrator.

    <p>
        If enabled by the administrator a phpMyFAQ installation can be completely secured. This means all content is
        only available after a successful login. For RSS feeds we provide a simple HTTP auth logic within the feeds
        to access for registered users. To avoid crawled content on search engines you should change the meta tags in
        index.tpl file from <em>INDEX, FOLLOW</em> to <em>NOINDEX, NOFOLLOW</em>.

        <strong><a name="5"></a>5. Administration</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The administration of phpMyFAQ is completely browser-based. The admin area can be found under this URL:
    </p>
    <code>http://www.example.com/faq/admin/index.php</code>
    <p>
        You can also login in the public front-end and after the successful login you'll see a link to administration
        back-end, too.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have lost your password you can reset it. A new random password will be generated and sent to you via
        e-mail. Please change it after your successful login with the generated password.
    </p>
    <p>
        After entering your username and password you can log into the system. On the start page you can see the
        administration menu on the top, some statistics about visits, entries, news and comments in the middle of the
        page. At the bottom of the main admin page you'll see a button for version information. If you click on that
        button your version of phpMyFAQ will check the latest version number from our website phpmyfaq.de. We do not
        log anything in this process! You can switch the current language in the administration back-end and you have
        an info box about the session timeout.

        <strong><a name="5a"></a>5.a. User Administration</strong>
    </p>
    <p>phpMyFAQ offers a flexible management of privileges (or rights) for different
    users in the admin area. To search for a certain user just start typing the username
    in the input form and you'll get a list of hits for usernames. It is possible to assign
    different privileges to real people (represented by the term users). Those privileges
    are very detailed and specific, so that you could allow a certain user to edit but
    not to delete an entry. It is very important to contemplate which user shall get which
    privileges. You could edit an entry by completely deleting all content, which would
    be equivalent to deleting the whole entry. The number of possible users is not limited
    by phpMyFAQ.</p>
    <p>Keep in mind that new users have no privileges at all, you will have to assign
    them by editing the user's profile. The <em>admin</em> user cannot be deleted,
    nor can the name be changed.</p>
    <p>A user without any permission in the admin section can still get read access
    to categories and records. You can set the permissions on categories and records
    in the category and record administration front-ends.</p>
    <p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>


    <hr style="width: 90%; height: 1px;"  />
    <p><strong><a name="5b"></a>5.b. Group Administration</strong></p>
    <p>phpMyFAQ also offers a flexible management of privileges (or rights) for
    different groups in the admin area. You can set permissions for groups in the
    same way like for users described in the topic above.</p>
    <p>Please note that the permissions for a group are higher rated than the permissions
    on a user.</p>
    <p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>


    <hr style="width: 90%; height: 1px;"  />
    <p><strong><a name="5c"></a>5.c. Category Administration</strong></p>
    <p>phpMyFAQ lets you create different categories and nested sub-categories for
    your FAQ. You can also re-arrange your categories in a different order. It is
    possible to use various languages per category, too; there's also a front-end about
    all translated categories. For accessibility reasons you should add a small description
    for every category. If you add a new category, you can set the permissions for
    users and groups, and you can bind an administrator to that category. This is
    quite nice if you want to share the work in your FAQ between various admin users.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>


    <hr style="width: 90%; height: 1px;"  />
    <p><strong><a name="5d"></a>5.d. Record Administration</strong></p>
    <p>You can create entries directly in the admin area. Created entries are NOT
    published by default. All available entries are listed on the page "edit FAQs".
    By clicking on them the same interface that lets you create records will open up,
    this time with all the relevant data of the specific entry. The meaning of the
    fields is as follows:</p>

    <ul>

    <li><strong>Category</strong><br />
    The place in the FAQ hierarchy where this entry will be published depends on
    these settings. You can choose one or more categories where to store the entry.
    If you want to add a FAQ record to more than one category you have to select
    the categories with your mouse and press the CTRL key.</li>

    <li><strong>Question</strong><br />
    This is the question or headline of your entry. </li>

    <li><strong>Answer</strong><br />The content is an answer to the question or a
    solution for a problem. The content can be edited with the included WYSIWYG
    (<strong>W</strong>hat <strong>Y</strong>ou <strong>S</strong>ee <strong>I</strong>s
    <strong>W</strong>hat <strong>Y</strong>ou <strong>G</strong>et) editor when
    JavaScript is enabled. You can place images where you want with the integrated
    image manager.</li>

    <li><strong>Keywords</strong><br />
    Keywords are relevant for searching through the database. In case you didn't
    include a specific word in the entry itself, but it is closely related to the
    content you may wish to include it as a keyword, so the entry will come up as a
    search result. It is also possible to use non-related keywords so that a wrongly
    entered search will also lead to the right results.</li>

    <li><strong>Tags</strong><br />
    You can add some tags about the current entry here. An Ajax-based auto-completion
    method helps you while typing your tags.</li>

    <li><strong>Author</strong><br />
    It is possible to specify an author for your entry.</li>

    <li><strong>E-Mail</strong><br />
    It is possible to specify the author's e-mail for your entry, but the e-mail
    address won't be shown in the front-end.</li>

    <li><strong>Language</strong><br />
    You can select the language of your entry. By default the selected language saved
    in the configuration will be chosen. You can create entries in multiple languages
    like this: Write an article in English (or any other language) and save it. Now
    choose <em>edit records</em> and edit your English entry. Change the theme, content
    and keywords and change language to, let's say Brazilian Portuguese. <em>Save</em>
    the entry. Now you can, when you click <em>edit records</em>, see both entries in
    your list, having the same id, yet different languages.</li>

    <li><strong>Solution ID</strong><br />
    Every entry generates automatically a so-called solution ID. All records can be
    accessed directly by putting this ID into the search box.</li>

    <li><strong>Active?</strong><br />
    If an entry is "active" it is visible in the public area and will be included in
    searches. Is it "deactivated" it will be invisible. Suggested entries are deactivated
    by default to prevent any abuse.</li>

    <li><strong>Sticky?</strong><br />
    If an entry is "sticky" it is a very important FAQ record and will be shown always on
    all pages on the right column. You should mark records as sticky if they are very important
    for your whole FAQ. Sticky records also appear at the top positions of the lists of FAQ entries.</li>

    <li><strong>Comments?</strong><br />
    If you do not want to allow public comments for this entry you can disable the
    feature here.</li>

    <li><strong>Revision</strong><br />
    Like a wiki, phpMyFAQ 2 supports revisions of every entry. New revisions won't be
    created automatically but you can create a new one if you click on "yes". The old
    revision will be stored in the database and the new current revision will be displayed
    in the public front-end. You can also bring back old revisions into the front-end
    if you select an old revision and save them as a new one.</li>

    <li><strong>Date</strong><br />
    You have three options for the FAQ creation date. You can choose to refresh the date
    of the FAQ entry for every update, or you can keep the date, or you can set an
    individual date for the FAQ entry.</li>

    <li><strong>Permissions</strong><br />
    If you add or edit a new entry, you can set the permissions for users and groups.</li>

    <li><strong>Record expiration time window</strong><br />
    If you need to you can set a time frame from one date to a second date when the
    FAQ entry should be valid and visible. Before and after this time frame the entry
    isn't visible and cannot be accessed.</li>

    <li><strong>Date</strong><br />
    Date of the last change.</li>

    <li><strong>Changed?</strong><br />
    This field is reserved for comments that can reflect what changes have been applied
    to a certain entry. This helps multiple admins to keep track of what happened
    to the entry over time. Any information entered here will remain invisible in
    the public area.</li>

    <li><strong>Changelog</strong><br />
    The changelog lists all previous changes, including user and date of change.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can edit and delete all records as well. Please note that old revisions
    won't be deleted.</p>
    <p>phpMyFAQ lets visitors contribute to the FAQ by asking questions. Every visitor
    is able to view these open questions in the public area, and may give an answer. If
    you wish to get rid of open questions you can do so using this section. Alternatively
    you can take over a question and answer it yourself and hereby add it to the FAQ.</p>

    <p>
        Below every entry visitors have the chance to rate the overall quality of a FAQ by giving ratings from
        1 to 5 (whereas 1 is the worst, 5 the best rating). In the statistics the average rating and number of votes
        becomes visible for every rated entry. To give you a quick overview entries with an average rating of 2 or
        worse are displayed in red, an average above 4 results in a green number.

    <p>
        <strong>View Sessions</strong><br />
        This functions lets you keep track of your visitors. Every visitor is assigned an ID when coming to your
        starting page, that identifies him during his whole visit. Using the information gathered here you could
        reconstruct the way visitors use your FAQ and make necessary adjustments to your categories, content or
        keywords.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>View Adminlog</strong><br />
        The adminlog allows you to track any actions taken by users in the admin area of phpMyFAQ. If you feel you
        have an intruder in the system you can find out for sure by checking the admin log.

        <strong>Search statistics</strong><br />
        On the search statistics page you'll get a report about which keywords and how often your users are searching.

        percentage.

        Using the backup function it is possible to create a copy of the database to a single file. This makes it
        possible to restore the FAQ after a possible "crash" or to move the FAQ from one server to another. It is
        recommended to make regular backups of your FAQ.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>backup data</strong><br />
            A backup of all <strong>data</strong> will include all entries, users, comments, etc.

        <li>
            <strong>URL Verifier configuration</strong><br />
            The URL Verifier works in the back while you save a new FAQ. It checks your added FAQ for links and tests
            the accessibility of all links in your document. In the URL Verifier configuration you can add, edit and
            delete special URLs. You can add an ignore list of URLs and a list of URLs which always return a warning
            message.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Stop Words configuration</strong><br />
            We need stop words for the smart answering feature. If an user is adding a new question to your FAQ the
            words will be checked against all FAQs in your database but without the stop words. Stop words are words
            with a very low relevance like the English word "the".
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Interface translation</strong><br />
            With this interface it is possible to edit all available translations of phpMyFAQ. You only can edit
            translations when the language file is writable. The interface checks that for you. If you like you can
            also send your improved translation to the phpMyFAQ Team. You cannot change the English translation because
            this is the main language file.

            In order to host several distinct installations (with different configs, different templates and
            most importantly, different database credentials), but only want to update once,
            you need to follow these steps:

            <ul>
              <li>
                  Make sure you have the <tt>multisite/</tt> directory in your document root and <tt>multisite.php</tt>
                  in it
              </li>
              <li>
                  For every seperate installation there needs to be a subdirectory of <tt>multisite/</tt> named
                  exactly like the hostname of the seperate installation.<br />
                  For example, if you want to use <em>faq.example.org</em> and <em>beta.faq.example.org</em>,
                  it needs to look like this:<br />
<pre>
.

        The default layout of phpMyFAQ is saved in the <strong>index.tpl</strong> file. This is a normal HTML5 file
        including some variables in curly brackets, serving as placeholders for content.
    </p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <code>&lt;span class="useronline"&gt;{userOnline}&lt;/span&gt;</code>
    <p>
        The template-parser of the FAQ converts the placeholder <em>{userOnline}</em> to the actual number of visitors
        online.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can change the template as you wish, but you may want to keep the original template in case something goes
        wrong.

    <p>
        All formatting such as fonts and the like can be modified in the CSS-file <strong>style.css</strong> for
        left-to-right languages and in <strong>style.rtl.css</strong> for left-to-right languages.

        <strong><a name="7"></a>7. Customizing phpMyFAQ</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        phpMyFAQ users have even more customization opportunities. The key feature is the user selectable template
        sets, there is a templates/default directory where the default layouts get shipped.

    <p><strong><a name="7a"></a>7.a. Creating a custom layout</strong></p>
    <p>
        Follow these steps to create a custom template set:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            copy the directory templates/default to templates/&lt;custom_template_set&gt;
        </li>
        <li>
            adjust template files in templates/&lt;custom_template_set&gt; to fit your needs
        </li>
        <li>
            activate &lt;custom_template_set&gt; within Admin->Config->Main
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> There is a magic variable <em>{tplSetName}</em> containing the name of the actual layout
        available in each template file.

    </p>
    <p>
        Beginning with version 2.6 phpMyFAQ will offer more and more interfaces to access phpMyFAQ installations with
        other clients like the iPhone.

        <strong><a name="8a"></a>8.a. rest/json API</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        phpMyFAQ includes a rest/json interface and offers an API for various services like fetching the phpMyFAQ
        version and the phpMyFAQ API version. Currently we implemented an interface for the search, the possibility
        to fetch all categories, all FAQ entries for a selected category and a FAQ entry.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can call the resources with the following URIs:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>getVersion()</strong>
        <p>This method returns the phpMyFAQ version number as string.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>http://www.example.org/phpmyfaq/api.php?action=getVersion (standard)</li>
            <li>http://www.example.org/phpmyfaq/api/getVersion (rewrite rules enabled)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The result will be a string value like this:</p>
        <code>
        {"version":"2.8.0"}
        </code></li>

        <li><strong>getApiVersion()</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>http://www.example.org/phpmyfaq/api.php?action=getApiVersion (standard)</li>
            <li>http://www.example.org/phpmyfaq/api/getApiVersion (rewrite rules enabled)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Returns the version of the API as an integer value. The version number is incremental and will be incremented
            every time the API changes.
        </p>
        <code>
        {"apiVersion":1}
