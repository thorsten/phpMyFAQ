# Contributing

Since phpMyFAQ is an Open Source project we encourage developers to contribute patches and code for us to include in the main 
package of phpMyFAQ. However there are a few rules and limitations when doing so and this page list them.

1. Contributed code will be licensed under the MPL 2.0 license.
2. Copyright notices will be changed to phpMyFAQ Team. But contributors will get credit for their work!
3. All third party code will be reviewed, tested and possible modified before being released.

These basic rules makes it possible for us to earn a living of the phpMyFAQ project but it also ensures that the code remains 
Open Source and under the MPL 2.0 license. All contributions will be added to the changelog and on the phpMyFAQ website.
