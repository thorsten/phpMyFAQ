## Installation

### phpMyFAQ installation package for end-users

The best way to install phpMyFAQ is to download it on [phpmyfaq.de](https://www.phpmyfaq.de/download), unzip the package
and open http://www.example.org/phpmyfaq/setup/index.php in your preferred browser.

### phpMyFAQ installation with Docker

#### Dockerfile

The Dockerfile provided in this repo only build an environment to run any release it's for development purpose. It does
not contain any code as the phpmyfaq folder is meant to be mount as the `/var/www/html` folder in the container.

To build a production release please use the [docker-hub](https://github.com/phpMyFAQ/docker-hub) repository or use
images provided on [docker.io](https://hub.docker.com/r/phpmyfaq/phpmyfaq/).

#### docker-compose.yml

For development purposes you can start a full stack to run your current PhpMyFAQ source code from your local repo.

    $ docker-compose up

The command above starts 6 containers for multi database development as following.

_Specific images started once to prepare the project:_

- **composer**: update composer dependencies
- **yarn**: update yarn dependencies

_Running using named volumes:_

- **mariadb**: image with MariaDB database with xtrabackup support
- **postgres**: image with PostgreSQL database
- **elasticsearch**: Open Source Software image (it means it does not have XPack installed)
- **phpmyadmin**: a PHP tool to have a look on your database.

_Running apache web server with PHP 7.4 support:_

- **phpmyfaq**: mounts the `phpmyfaq` folder in place of `/var/www/html`.

Then services will be available at following addresses:

- phpMyFAQ: (http://localhost:8080)
- phpMyAdmin: (http://localhost:8000)

#### Running tests

To run the test using Docker you have to install the Composer development dependencies

    $ curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    $ php composer.phar install

#### Quote from ElasticSearch documentation

The vm.max_map_count kernel setting needs to be set to at least 262144 for production use. Depending on your platform:

##### Linux

The vm.max*map_count setting should be set permanently in */etc/sysctl.conf\_:

    $ grep vm.max_map_count /etc/sysctl.conf
    vm.max_map_count=262144

To apply the setting on a live system type: `sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144`

##### macOS with Docker for Mac

The vm.max_map_count setting must be set within the xhyve virtual machine:

    $ screen ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/Data/com.docker.driver.amd64-linux/tty

Log in with root and no password. Then configure the sysctl setting as you would for Linux:

    $ sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144

##### Windows and macOS with Docker Toolbox

The vm.max_map_count setting must be set via docker-machine:

    $ docker-machine ssh
    $ sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144

    $ git clone git://github.com/thorsten/phpMyFAQ.git

## Versioning

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, phpMyFAQ will
be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

- Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
- New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
- Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch
